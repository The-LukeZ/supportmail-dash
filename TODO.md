# TODO

- Fix hooks.server.ts - Ist it a good practice to fetch all data on server? Maybe it's better to fetch only data that is needed?

- How (esp. WHERE) to do auth check?
- How to access API from root page?

## Later

- Implement oauth2 logout route
- Ask: How to determine when refreshToken should be used? Maybe when accessToken is expired? How to determine accessToken expired?
- Implement functionality for refreshToken
